# The volume of a sphere with radius r is (4/3)* pie * r**2. 
# What is the volume of the sphere with radius 5. 
# Make sure the program enters the radius from the keyboard and provide the answer in 2 decimal places

# Create a program to calculate the area of a triangle (1/2 * base * height). 
# Base and height should be entered using the keyboard. 

#Question One
# WITI has tasked you to automate a simple grading system. 
# As a python student, write a program using  to display the grades that 
# the students will be receiving based on the mark scored in a subject. 
# The grades are:
# 90% - 100%  Grade is A
# 80% - 89%   Grade is  B
# 70% - 79%   Grade is C                                                        
# 60% - 69%   Grade is D                  
# 50% - 59%   Grade is E  
# < 50% Fail 

#  WITI Academy is proposing a Sacco to help students save their money. 
#  Design a platform that will do the following.
#  Welcome to, WITIAcademy Sacco.
#  1. Deposit Money
#  2. Withdraw Money
#  3. Check Balance
#  Ensure if the student selects 1, money is deposited and the minimum deposit should be 1000.
#  If the student selects 2, money should be withdrawn and a minimum withdrawal is 500.
#  If the student selects 3, the account balance should be displayed.
